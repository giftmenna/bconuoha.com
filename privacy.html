Your Rights under the GDPR
Data protection is a fundamental right set out in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states;
Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned, or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
This means that every individual is entitled to have their personal information protected, used in a fair and legal way, and made available to them when they ask for a copy. If an individual feels that their personal information is wrong, they are entitled to ask for that information to be corrected.
In order to process personal data, organisations must have a lawful reason. The lawful reasons for processing personal data are set out in Article 6 of the GDPR. The six lawful reasons for processing personal data are:
Consent.
To carry out a contract.
In order for an organisation to meet a legal obligation.
Where processing the personal data is necessary to protect the vital interests of a person.
Where processing the personal data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
In the legitimate interests of a company/organisation (except where those interests contradict or harm the interests or rights and freedoms of the individual).
Any one of the six reasons given above can provide a legal reason for processing personal data.
The tabs at the side of this page will take you to more detailed information about:
your individual rights under data protection;
how to exercise those rights for yourself; and
how to raise a concern with the Data Protection Commission in cases where you feel your rights are not being respected.
It is important to remembe



Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to exercise control over your personal data and ensure your privacy is protected. However, it's important to note that I, as an AI language model, cannot provide legally binding advice or create official GDPR rights. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional or privacy expert to obtain accurate and up-to-date information tailored to your specific circumstances. That being said, here is an example of a right that can be related to Google AdSense:
Right to Consent and Control over Personalized Advertising:
As a user, you have the right to provide or withdraw your explicit and informed consent for the processing of your personal data for personalized advertising purposes when using Google AdSense. You should have the ability to exercise granular control over the types of ads you receive, the data used to personalize these ads, and the ability to easily withdraw consent or opt-out of personalized advertising altogether. This right includes:
1. Transparent Information: The right to receive clear and concise information about the purposes, methods, and scope of data processing for personalized advertising.
2. Explicit Consent: The right to provide or withhold your explicit consent before your personal data is used for personalized advertising.
3. Access and Control: The right to access the personal data collected for personalized advertising and the ability to review, update, or delete this data.
4. Opt-Out Mechanism: The right to easily and freely opt-out of personalized advertising, including the ability to disable personalized ads directly in your Google AdSense settings or through a clear and accessible mechanism.
5. Non-Discrimination: The right to not face any discriminatory treatment or denial of services if you choose to opt-out of personalized advertising.
Remember, this is a general example, and it is important to seek legal advice to ensure compliance with GDPR and any other applicable privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
